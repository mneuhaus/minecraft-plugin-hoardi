# The Zen of Hoardi

Proximity beats perfection.
Categories emerge, they are not imposed.
Full chests split their burden.
The first item claims the chest.
Shelves reflect, they do not dictate.
Two shelves see more than one.
Networks stay in their lane.
Empty space is opportunity.
Shulkers are backpacks with anxiety.
Barrels are round chests. We don't judge.
Close a chest to whisper. Sort to shout.
The hoarder who sorts manually has not found this plugin.

*In chaos, there is cobblestone. In organization, there is also cobblestone—but you can find it.*
